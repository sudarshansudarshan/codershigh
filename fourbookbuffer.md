## The Puzzle

You need to get **100 books** home from the library, at the rate of **one new book every week**.

- The books you ultimately need are in a known sequence:
  $$b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots, b_{100}$$

- At any time, you can hold **only 4 books**.
  Let the set of books currently with you be:
  $$z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4$$

Each week:

1. You go to the library and receive the next required book in the sequence.
2. Since you can carry only 4 books, you must **give up exactly one** of the 4 books you currently have, to make space for the new one.

So, if your current holding is
$$\{z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4\}$$
and the next required book is $$b_k$$, then after the swap your holding becomes:
$$\{z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4\} \setminus \{z_i\} \cup \{b_k\}$$
for some choice of $$i \in \{1,2,3,4\}$$.

## The Core Question

By the time you are about to bring home the final book $$b_{100}$$:

1. **Which book will you give up** (from your current four) to make room for $$b_{100}$$?
2. In the **next week**, you again receive the next book in the sequence (think of it as continuing beyond 100), and must give up one of your four again:
   - **Which book will you give up next week?**
3. And in the weeks after that:
   - **What is your strategy for deciding which book to give up each time?**

## What You Know

- You know the entire required sequence:
  $$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{100}$$
- You always receive the next book in order.
- You always have exactly four books in hand.
- You must decide which one to drop each week.

## Your Task

Give a clear strategy (or rule) that determines, for each week:

- which book among
  $$z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4$$
  should be given up, so that you can proceed through the sequence as efficiently as possible—especially answering:

- which book you drop when bringing in $$b_{100}$$, and
- what you drop in the subsequent week, and the weeks after that.
