# Mastering Loops in TypeScript


## 1. Problem Statement

A city library needs a **Transaction Processor** that can handle hundreds of book check-ins, check-outs, and returns every day. The system must:

-   Iterate through lists of transactions.
    
-   Stop processing when a priority book arrives.
    
-   Skip cancelled transactions.
    
-   Tally total transactions per day.
    
-   Process at least one pending return even if the queue is short.
    
-   Summarize inventory and active visitors.
    

Manually handling this in spreadsheets is too slow and error-prone. You need to use loops in TypeScript to automate these tasks efficiently.

## 2. Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

-   Use **`for`**, **`while`**, and **`do…while`** loops for definite and indefinite iteration.
    
-   Apply **`break`** to exit loops early.
    
-   Apply **`continue`** to skip to the next iteration.
    
-   Use **`for…in`** to iterate object keys.
    
-   Use **`for…of`** to iterate array and string values.
    
-   Avoid infinite loops and common pitfalls.

## 3. Concept Introduction with Analogy


Imagine you start your day at the library’s  **Conveyor Belt Station**. This belt brings in little bins-each bin is a “transaction packet” that tells you what happened with a book (checkout, return, cancellation, or a high-priority request). Here’s how your shift unfolds:

1.  **Inspecting Each Bin (Loops)**  
    The belt never stops unless you tell it to. You pick up each bin one by one, inspect its label, and decide what to do. This is your loop-processing each transaction in order.
    
2.  **Skipping Cancellations (`continue`)**  
    Some bins are marked  **“Cancelled”**-no action needed. You glance at them, set them aside, and wave the belt on. In code, you use  `continue`  to skip the rest of the steps for that iteration and move to the next bin.
    
3.  **Handling Priority Requests (`break`)**  
    Every so often, a bin arrives with a  **“PRIORITY”**  sticker-this is an urgent reservation. You press the big red button and stop the belt so you can process that first. In code, you use  `break`  to exit the loop immediately and deal with high-priority work.
    
4.  **Ensuring at Least One Return (`do…while`)**  
    Even if the day’s returns aren’t queued, policy says you must check for a  **return**  at least once (in case a librarian added one while you were busy). You reach out, inspect a bin, and then keep checking until you’ve processed every return. That first guaranteed check is like a  `do…while`-run at least once, then repeat if the condition holds.
    
5.  **Keeping Daily Tallies (Loop Counters)**  
    At a corner of your workspace is a clipboard. Every time you handle a checkout, return, or priority, you tick a box on that clipboard. Your loop counters in code do the same-incrementing counts for each transaction type so you can report totals at day’s end.
    
6.  **Reviewing the Inventory Ledger (`for…in`)**  
    Between belt cycles, you glance at the library’s  **Inventory Ledger**, a book listing each title and its current stock. You flip through each entry-this is akin to a  `for…in`  loop over an object’s keys, checking “The Hobbit,” then “1984,” then “TypeScript Guide,” and so on.
    
7.  **Greeting Visitors (`for…of`)**  
    At the end of your shift, you have a list of visitors waiting at the front desk. You call out each name and welcome them: “Alice, your book is ready. Bob, enjoy your reading.” That’s a  `for…of`  loop-iterating directly over an array of visitor names and performing an action for each.

## 4. Technical Deep Dive: Loop Types in TypeScript

| Loop Type | Use Case                                             | Syntax                                  |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| for       | Known iterations (e.g., array or fixed count)        | `for (init; condition; step) { ... }`   |
| while     | Unknown iterations until a condition becomes false   | `while (condition) { ... }`             |
| do…while  | Run block at least once, then repeat if condition true | `do { ... } while (condition);`       |
| for_in    | Iterate enumerable property keys of an object        | `for (let key in obj) { ... }`          |
| for_of    | Iterate values of iterable (array, string, etc.)     | `for (let item of iterable) { ... }`    |


Control Statements:

- **`break`**: Exit current loop immediately.
- **`continue`**: Skip the rest of this iteration, continue with next.

## 5. Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough

## 5.1 Data Modeling

```typescript
type Transaction = {
  id: number;
  type: "checkout" | "return" | "cancelled" | "priority";
};

const transactions: Transaction[] = [
  { id: 1, type: "checkout" },
  { id: 2, type: "cancelled" },
  { id: 3, type: "return" },
  { id: 4, type: "priority" },
  { id: 5, type: "checkout" }
];

const inventory: { [title: string]: number } = {
  "The Hobbit": 3,
  "1984": 5,
  "TypeScript Guide": 2
};

const visitors: string[] = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"];

```

## 5.2 `for` Loop: Process a Fixed List

```typescript
let totalProcessed = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < transactions.length; i++) {
  const tx = transactions[i];
  if (tx.type === "cancelled") {
    continue; // skip cancelled
  }
  if (tx.type === "priority") {
    console.log("Priority transaction encountered, stopping.");
    break;    // stop on priority
  }
  console.log(`Processing transaction ${tx.id}: ${tx.type}`);
  totalProcessed++;
}
console.log(`Total processed: ${totalProcessed}`);
```

## 5.3 `while` Loop: Process Until Empty

```typescript
let queue = [...transactions];
let processedWhile = 0;
while (queue.length > 0) {
  const tx = queue.shift()!;
  if (tx.type === "cancelled") continue;
  console.log(`While loop processed: ${tx.id}`);
  processedWhile++;
}
```

## Flow Diagram

## 5.4 `do…while` Loop: Always Run Once

```typescript
let pendingReturns = 0;
let idx = 0;
do {
  const tx = transactions[idx];
  if (tx.type === "return") {
    console.log(`Handling return transaction ${tx.id}`);
    pendingReturns++;
  }
  idx++;
} while (idx < transactions.length);
console.log(`Pending returns: ${pendingReturns}`);
```

## 6. Interactive Challenge / Mini-Project

**Your Turn!**

1.  Add a counter for each transaction type (`checkout`, `return`, `priority`, `cancelled`) using a **`for`** loop and an object.
    
2.  Use a **`while(true)`** infinite loop with a **`break`** condition when a new priority transaction arrives.
    
3.  Modify the **`do…while`** loop to handle a dynamic queue (an array you can `push` new returns into).
    
4.  Use **`for…in`** to reset all inventory counts to zero.
    
5.  Display visitor names in reverse order using a **`for`** or **`for…of`** loop.

## 7. Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

-   **Off-by-one errors** in `for` loops: ensure correct start and end conditions.
    
-   **Infinite loops**: always include a `break` or update condition.
    
-   **`for…in` on arrays**: returns string keys-use only for objects.
    
-   **`for…of` on objects**: not supported-use `for…in` or `Object.entries`.
    
-   **Clear loop counters**: avoid reusing loop variables across loops.
    

----------

## 8. Quick Recap & Key Takeaways

-   Use **`for`** for fixed or array-based iteration.
    
-   Use **`while`** when the iteration count is unknown.
    
-   Use **`do…while`** to guarantee at least one execution.
    
-   Use **`break`** and **`continue`** to control loop flow.
    
-   Use **`for…in`** for object keys, **`for…of`** for iterable values.
    

----------

## 9. Optional: Programmer’s Workflow Checklist

-   Choose the right loop type for the task.
    
-   Declare loop variables with proper types.
    
-   Avoid infinite loops-ensure exit conditions.
    
-   Use `break` and `continue` sparingly for clarity.
    
-   Leverage `for…in` for objects and `for…of` for arrays/strings.
    
-   Test each loop with edge cases (empty arrays, single items).
