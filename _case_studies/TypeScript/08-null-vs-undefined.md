# TypeScript – null vs. undefined

## 1. Problem Statement

## Case Study: The Real-Time User Profile Dashboard

You are building a real-time user profile dashboard for a social platform.

-   Some users may not have filled out all their profile details (like age or bio).
    
-   Sometimes, you need to show that a value is “intentionally empty” (e.g., user hasn’t set their age), while other times a value is simply “not yet set” (e.g., waiting for data from the server).
    
-   Your code must handle both situations safely, avoiding runtime errors and making it clear to other developers what each value means.
    

**The challenge:**  
How do you use  `null`  and  `undefined`  in TypeScript to clearly represent the difference between “no value” and “not yet set,” and how do you handle these values in user data and logic?

## 2. Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Understand the difference between  `null`  and  `undefined`  in TypeScript.
    
-   Know when to use  `null`  vs.  `undefined`  for variables, function returns, and object properties.
    
-   Safely check, assign, and handle both values in your code.
    
-   Model real-world data where some values may be missing or intentionally empty.
    

## 3. Concept Introduction with Analogy

## Analogy: Empty Seats vs. Unassigned Seats

Imagine a theater:

-   **An empty seat (null):**  The seat exists, but nobody is sitting there-it's intentionally left empty.
    
-   **An unassigned seat (undefined):**  The seat hasn’t been assigned yet-maybe the ticket system hasn’t finished processing.
    

In your dashboard,  `null`  means “this field is intentionally empty,” while  `undefined`  means “this field hasn’t been set yet.”

## 4. Technical Deep Dive

## What is  `null`?

-   `null`  is a primitive value representing “no value” or “empty.”
    
-   Explicitly assigned to a variable to show it is intentionally empty.
    
-   TypeScript treats  `null`  as its own type.
    

**Example:**

```typescript
let a: null = null;
console.log(a); // Output: null
console.log(typeof a); // Output: object
```

**Reinitializing with null:**

```typescript
let age: number | null = null;
console.log(age); // null
age = 28;
console.log(age); // 28
```

## What is  `undefined`?

-   `undefined`  means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value.
    
-   TypeScript automatically assigns  `undefined`  to uninitialized variables.
    
-   Can also be explicitly assigned.
    

**Example:**

```typescript
let b: undefined = undefined;
console.log(b); // Output: undefined
console.log(typeof b); // Output: undefined
```

**Uninitialized variable:**

```typescript
let c:  number; console.log(c);  // Output: undefined
```
**Function with no return:**

```typescript
function greet(name: string): void {
  console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
}
let result = greet("Alice");
console.log(result); // Output: undefined
```

## Key Differences Table
| Feature               | null                                 | undefined                         |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Meaning               | Explicitly no value                  | Not initialized                    |
| Typical Use           | Intentionally empty/absent value     | Variable declared but not assigned |
| Type Annotation       | Has its own type `null`              | Has its own type `undefined`       |
| Default Behavior      | Does not trigger default params      | Triggers default params            |
| Function Parameters   | Explicitly no value                  | Missing or optional parameters     |
| Object Properties     | Deliberately set to no value         | May not be initialized             |
| Operational Handling  | Must be handled in logic             | Often handled with defaults        |


## 5. Step-by-Step Data Modeling & Code Walkthrough

1.  **User type with nullable and optional properties:**
    
    ```typescript
	type User = {
	  name: string;
	  age: number | null;
	  email?: string;
	};
	```
    
2.  **User with null and undefined properties:**
	  ```typescript 
	  let user1: User = {
	   name: "John Doe",
	   age: null, // Explicitly no age
	   email: "john@example.com"
	};

	let user2: User = {
	   name: "Jane Doe",
	   age: 25
	   // email is optional and thus undefined
	};
	```
    
3.  **Checking and handling values:**
    ```typescript
    function printUser(user: User): void {
	  let ageInfo = user.age === null ? "Age not provided" : `Age: ${user.age}`;
	  let emailInfo = user.email ? `Email: ${user.email}` : "Email not set";
	  console.log(`${user.name} - ${ageInfo}, ${emailInfo}`);
	}

	printUser(user1); // John Doe - Age not provided, Email: john@example.com
	printUser(user2); // Jane Doe - Age: 25, Email not set
    ```
    

## 6. Interactive Challenge

**Your Turn!**

-   Define a type  `Profile`  with  `username`  (string),  `bio`  (string or null), and optional  `avatarUrl`  (string).
    
-   Create two profiles: one with a null bio and no avatar, and one with both fields set.
    
-   Write a function  `showProfile`  that prints the username, a default message if bio is null, and a default avatar if  `avatarUrl`  is undefined.
    



**Explanation:**

-   `bio`  is explicitly set to  `null`  for profile1, so the function prints a default message.
    
-   `avatarUrl`  is missing for profile1, so the function uses a default image.
    
-   For profile2, all fields are set and printed as-is.
    

## 7. Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

-   **Don’t confuse  `null`  and  `undefined`:**  Use  `null`  for intentional emptiness,  `undefined`  for “not set yet.”
    
-   **Always check for both  `null`  and  `undefined`  when handling optional or missing values.**
    
-   **Use union types (`type | null`) for fields that can be empty.**
    
-   **Use optional properties (`prop?: type`) for fields that may be missing.**
    

## 8. Quick Recap & Key Takeaways

-   `null`  means “intentionally empty”;  `undefined`  means “not set yet.”
    
-   Use  `null`  for fields that are deliberately empty, and  `undefined`  for optional or not-yet-initialized values.
    
-   Always check and handle both cases in your logic for safe, predictable code.
    

## 9. Optional: Programmer’s Workflow Checklist

-   Use  `null`  for fields that are intentionally empty.
    
-   Use  `undefined`  for optional or not-yet-initialized fields.
    
-   Always check for both  `null`  and  `undefined`  before using a value.
    
-   Use union types and optional properties for flexibility.
    
-   Provide sensible defaults when displaying or using possibly missing values.
