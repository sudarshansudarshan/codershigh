# TypeScript – let & const

## 1. Problem Statement

Imagine you are developing a modern application where data must be handled safely and predictably.

-   Some values should be able to change as your program runs (like a user’s score or the current page).
    
-   Other values should never change once set (like a mathematical constant or the name of your application).
    
-   You want to avoid bugs caused by accidentally changing or reusing variables in the wrong place.
    

**The challenge:**  
How do you declare variables in TypeScript so that you control where and how they can be changed, and prevent accidental mistakes in your code?

## 2. Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Declare variables using `let` and `const` in TypeScript.
    
-   Understand the difference between block scope and function/global scope.
    
-   Recognize when to use `let` versus `const`.
    
-   Avoid common mistakes with variable redeclaration and reassignment.
    

## 3. Concept Introduction with Analogy

### Analogy: Lockers and Safes in a Secure Facility

-   **Let variables** are like lockers: you can open them, put in new items, or swap items out, but only if you have access to that room (block).
    
-   **Const variables** are like safes with a combination set once: you can put something in when you first use it, but after that, it’s locked forever and can’t be changed.
    
-   Both lockers and safes are only accessible in the room (block) where they’re placed.
    

This system keeps your valuables safe and prevents accidental mix-ups, just like `let` and `const` keep your data safe in TypeScript.

## 4. Technical Deep Dive

### Declaring Variables with `let`

-   The `let` keyword declares a variable with **block scope**.
    
-   You must follow the rules for naming identifiers.
    
-   You can assign a type and a value, or just a type.
    

**Syntax:**

```typescript
let var_name: var_type = value;
```
**Example:**

```typescript
let car_name: string = "Brezza";
let car_price: number = 1000000;
console.log(car_name);   // Output: Brezza
console.log(car_price);  // Output: 1000000
```

## Variable Scope

-   Variables declared with `let` are **block scoped**.
    
-   You cannot access a `let` variable outside the block where it is declared.
    

**Example:**

```typescript
let bool: boolean = true;
if (bool) {
    let result: number = 10;
    console.log(result); // Accessible here
}
// console.log(result); // Error: result is not defined here
```

## Redeclaration Rules

-   You **cannot re-declare** a variable with `let` in the same scope.
    

**Example:**

```typescript
let animal: string = "cat";
// let animal: string = "dog"; // Error: Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'animal'
console.log(animal); // Output: cat
```

## Same Name in Different Blocks

-   You **can** declare variables with the same name in different blocks.
    

**Example:**

```typescript
let bool: boolean = false;
if (bool) {
    let num: number = 1;
    console.log(num); // Only in this block
} else {
    let num: number = 2;
    console.log(num); // Only in this block
}
// Both num variables are separate and do not conflict.
```

## Declaring Variables with `const`

-   The `const` keyword declares a **constant** (cannot be changed after assignment).
    
-   Must be initialized at the time of declaration.
    
-   Has block scope, just like `let`.
    

**Syntax:**

```typescript
const var_name: var_type = value;
```

**Example:**

```typescript
const lang: string = 'TypeScript';
const PI: number = 3.14;
console.log(`Language: ${lang}`);      // Output: Language: TypeScript
console.log(`Value of PI: ${PI}`);     // Output: Value of PI: 3.14
```

## Const Rules: No Redeclaration or Reassignment

-   You **cannot re-declare** or **reassign** a `const` variable in the same scope.
    

**Example:**

```typescript
if (true) {
    const PI: number = 3.14;
    console.log(PI);
    // const PI: number = 3.14; // Error: Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'PI'.
    // PI = 3.15; // Error: Cannot assign to 'PI' because it is a constant.
}
```

## 5. Step-by-Step Data Modeling & Code Walkthrough

1.  **Declare a variable with `let`:**
    
   ```typescript
let userName:  string  =  "Alex";` 
  ```
2.  **Declare a constant with `const`:**
    
   ```typescript
    const  MAX_USERS:  number  =  100;
 ```
    
3.  **Block scope demonstration:**
    
   ```typescript
if (true) {
	let sessionId: string = "abc123";
	console.log(sessionId); // Works here
}
	// console.log(sessionId); // Error: sessionId is not defined here
```
    
4.  **No redeclaration or reassignment with `const`:**
```typescript
const appName: string = "MyApp";
// appName = "YourApp"; // Error: Cannot assign to 'appName'
```
    

## 6. Interactive Challenge 

**Your Turn!**

-   Declare a variable `score` with `let` and assign it a number.
    
-   Inside a block (e.g., an `if` statement), declare another `score` variable with a different value and print it.
    
-   Declare a constant `COUNTRY` and assign it your favorite country.
    
-   Try to change the value of `COUNTRY` and observe what happens.
    
-   Try to re-declare `score` in the same block and see the result.
    


## 8. Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

-   **Always initialize `const` variables when declaring them.**
    
-   **Use `let` for variables that change, `const` for variables that never change.**
    
-   **Don’t try to access block-scoped variables outside their block.**
    
-   **Never redeclare a `let` or `const` variable in the same scope.**
    
-   **Prefer `const` by default for safety; use `let` only when necessary.**
    

## 8. Quick Recap & Key Takeaways

-   `let` and `const` provide block scope and prevent accidental redeclaration.
    
-   Use `let` for variables that may change, `const` for values that should never change.
    
-   Both `let` and `const` are safer and more predictable than traditional variable declarations.
    
-   Always initialize `const` variables and avoid reassigning them.
    

## 9. Optional: Programmer’s Workflow Checklist

-   Use `let` for variables that may change.
    
-   Use `const` for variables that should never change.
    
-   Never redeclare a variable with `let` or `const` in the same scope.
    
-   Always initialize `const` variables.
    
-   Keep variable scope as small as possible (prefer block scope).
    
-   Test variable access inside and outside blocks to understand scope.
