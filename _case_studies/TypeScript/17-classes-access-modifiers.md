## 1. Problem Statement

**Problem Statement: EduFlow’s Content Control Crisis**

EduFlow Academy is a rapidly growing EdTech Startup.  
But chaos is brewing:

-  **Learners** are somehow changing quiz questions after starting a quiz.
    
-   **Instructors** sometimes accidentally publish unfinished lessons.
    
-   **Admins** want to review everything, but sometimes they accidentally change published or sensitive content.
- 
  ![Role-Based Access](https://i.postimg.cc/W3gcGZVP/image-1.png)   

**Your mission:**  
Design a system so that:

-   Learners can only view and submit answers.
    
-   Instructors can create and edit content, but only before it’s published.
    
-   Admins can review all content, but not accidentally change published materials.
    

**Expected outcome:**  
A secure, organized platform where each role has just the right level of access, and shared features are coded only once.

## 2. Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

-   Use  `public`,  `private`, and  `protected`  to control access to data and actions.
    
-   Apply inheritance to share common features between content types.
    
-   Create abstract classes as blueprints for specialized content.
    
-   Build a secure, organized content management system for EduFlow Academy.
    

## 3. Concept Introduction with Office Building Analogy

**Think of your code as an office building:**
| Area/Room            | Access Modifier  | Who Can Enter?                                    | What Happens Here?                      |
|----------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Lobby & Hallways     | public           | Everyone (employees, managers, directors)        | Viewing shared info, casual meetings    |
| Manager’s Office     | private          | Only the manager (the class itself)              | Working on sensitive projects           |
| Shared Meeting Room  | protected        | Managers and directors (class & subclasses)      | Team planning, confidential reviews     |
| Building Blueprint   | Abstract Class   | Blueprint for all rooms                         | Sets required features for all rooms    |



Sets required features for all rooms

-   **public:**  Open to all, like the lobby.
    
-   **private:**  Only for the room owner, like a locked office.
    
-   **protected:**  For managers and directors, like a meeting room with restricted access.
    
-   **abstract class:**  The blueprint for all rooms; you can’t walk into a blueprint, but every room follows its design.
    
  ## **What Are Classes in TypeScript?**

A  **class**  in TypeScript is a blueprint for creating objects with specific properties (fields) and methods (functions).  
Classes support  **object-oriented programming**  concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction

## **Access Modifiers: Controlling Visibility**

Access modifiers determine  **where class members (properties and methods) can be accessed**.

## **Public**

-   **Default**  modifier.
    
-   Members are accessible from anywhere (inside/outside the class)
  ```typescript
class Person {
  public name: string;
  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
const p = new Person("Alice");
console.log(p.name); // OK
  ```
  ## **Private**

-   Accessible  **only within the class**  where declared.
    
-   Not accessible in subclasses or from outside.
 ```typescript
class Secret {
  private code: string;
  constructor(code: string) {
    this.code = code;
  }
  reveal() {
    return this.code;
  }
}
const s = new Secret("1234");
// console.log(s.code); // Error: Property 'code' is private
console.log(s.reveal()); // OK
 ```
## **Protected**

-   Accessible  **within the class and its subclasses**  (not outside)
  ```typescript
class Animal {
  protected species: string;
  constructor(species: string) {
    this.species = species;
  }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
  bark() {
    return `Woof! I am a ${this.species}`;
  }
}
const d = new Dog("canine");
console.log(d.bark()); // OK
// console.log(d.species); // Error: Property 'species' is protected
  ```

## **Read-Only**

-   Not an access modifier, but ensures the value can’t be changed after initialization.
  ```typescript
class Book {
  readonly isbn: string;
  constructor(isbn: string) {
    this.isbn = isbn;
  }
}
const b = new Book("123-456");
// b.isbn = "789-101"; // Error: Cannot assign to 'isbn' because it is a read-only property
  ```

## **Inheritance: Extending Classes**

**Inheritance**  lets you create a new class (child/subclass) that  **inherits**  properties and methods from another class (parent/superclass)


  ```typescript
class Vehicle {
  public brand: string;
  constructor(brand: string) {
    this.brand = brand;
  }
  drive() {
    console.log(`${this.brand} is moving`);
  }
}
class Car extends Vehicle {
  public model: string;
  constructor(brand: string, model: string) {
    super(brand); // calls Vehicle's constructor
    this.model = model;
  }
  drive() {
    super.drive(); // call parent method
    console.log(`Model: ${this.model}`);
  }
}
const myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla");
myCar.drive();
// Output: Toyota is moving
//         Model: Corolla

  ```
  The `super` keyword calls the parent class’s constructor or methods.
## **Abstract Classes: Defining Contracts**

An  **abstract class**  is a class that  **cannot be incorporated directly**. It’s used as a base for other classes and can include:

-   **Abstract methods**: Declared without implementation-must be implemented by subclasses.
    
-   **Concrete methods**: Fully implemented in the abstract class.
## **Combining Access Modifiers with Constructors**

 ```typescript
class Person {
  constructor(public name: string, private age: number) {}
  public getAge(): number {
    return this.age;
  }
}
const john = new Person('John', 30);
console.log(john.name); // OK
console.log(john.getAge()); // OK
// console.log(john.age); // Error: 'age' is private
 ```

TypeScript allows you to declare and initialize properties directly in the constructor using access modifiers


## 4. Step-by-Step Data Modeling

Let’s start by designing the  **Content blueprint**  that every content type must follow.

  ```typescript
// Abstract class: the blueprint for all content
abstract class Content {
  public readonly title: string;
  public readonly author: string;
  private published: boolean = false;

  constructor(title: string, author: string) {
    this.title = title;
    this.author = author;
  }

  public publish() {
    this.published = true;
  }

  protected isPublished(): boolean {
    return this.published;
  }

  // Every content type must say what type it is
  abstract getType(): string;
}

  ```
-   `Content`  is the  **abstract class**  (blueprint).
    
-   Every content has a title, an author, and can be published (locked for editing).
    
-   Only subclasses must implement  `getType()`.
    

## 5. Live Code Walkthrough

## Quiz: Controlled Question Editing

  ```typescript
class Quiz extends Content {
  private questions: string[] = [];

  constructor(title: string, author: string, questions: string[] = []) {
    super(title, author);
    this.questions = questions;
  }

  public addQuestion(question: string, isInstructor: boolean) {
    if (!this.isPublished() && isInstructor) {
      this.questions.push(question);
    } else {
      throw new Error("Cannot add questions after publishing or if not an instructor.");
    }
  }

  public getQuestions(): string[] {
    return [...this.questions];
  }

  getType(): string {
    return "Quiz";
  }
}

  ```
-   Only instructors can add questions, and only before publishing.
    

## Lesson: Safe Content Editing

  ```typescript

class Lesson extends Content {
  private content: string;

  constructor(title: string, author: string, content: string) {
    super(title, author);
    this.content = content;
  }

  public editContent(newContent: string, isInstructor: boolean) {
    if (!this.isPublished() && isInstructor) {
      this.content = newContent;
    } else {
      throw new Error("Cannot edit content after publishing or if not an instructor.");
    }
  }

  public getContent(): string {
    return this.content;
  }

  getType(): string {
    return "Lesson";
  }
}

  ```
-   Only instructors can edit content, and only before publishing.
    

## 6. Challenge 

**Your Turn!**

-   Create an  `Assignment`  class extending  `Content`.
    
-   Add a  `dueDate`  property (private).
    
-   Allow only instructors to set or update the due date before publishing.
    
-   Implement  `getType()`  returning  `"Assignment"`.
    

Try it yourself before checking the solution!
    

## 7. Quick Recap & Key Takeaways

-   **`public`**: Anyone can use these features.
    
-   **`private`**: Only the class itself can access.
    
-   **`protected`**: Shared with subclasses.
    
-   **Inheritance**: Share common features across different content types.
    
-   **Abstract classes**: Set blueprints for all content, requiring certain features.
    

## 8. (Optional) Programmer’s Workflow Checklist

-   Identify shared features for all content → put in abstract class.
    
-   Use  `private`  for sensitive info (questions, content, due dates).
    
-   Use  `protected`  for features shared with subclasses.
    
-   Expose safe actions with  `public`  methods.
    
-   Test access by role (learner, instructor, admin).
