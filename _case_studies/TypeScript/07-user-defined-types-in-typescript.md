#  User-Defined Types in TypeScript

## 1. Problem Statement

You are building a patient management system for a hospital.

-   Each patient record must track personal details, vital signs, and medical history.
    
-   Different types of staff (doctors, nurses, admins) interact with the system, each with different permissions and data needs.
    
-   The system must handle collections of patients, structured medical records, and specialized data like test results or medication schedules.
    
-   You need to ensure that all data is organized, type-safe, and easy to extend as requirements change.
    

**The challenge:**  
How do you use TypeScript’s user-defined types (arrays, tuples, enums, classes, interfaces) to model complex, real-world data in a way that is safe, maintainable, and scalable?

## 2. Learning Objectives

-   Create and use arrays, tuples, and enums in TypeScript.
    
-   Define custom types using interfaces and classes.
    
-   Model real-world data structures with type safety.
    
-   Use user-defined types to organize and scale your codebase.
    

## 3. Concept Introduction with Analogy

### Analogy: The Hospital Filing Cabinet

A hospital’s filing cabinet contains:

-   **Folders**  for each patient (arrays).
    
-   **Tabs**  for specific info (tuples).
    
-   **Color-coded labels**  for patient status (enums).
    
-   **Standard forms**  for personal info and medical history (interfaces).
    
-   **Specialized folders**  for doctors, nurses, and admins (classes).
    

This system keeps patient data organized, consistent, and easy to find-just like user-defined types in TypeScript.

## 4. Technical Deep Dive

## Arrays

-   Store collections of values of the same type.
    
-   Can use  `type[]`  or  `Array<type>`  syntax.
    
```typescript
let patientIds: number[] = [101, 102, 103];
let patientNames: Array<string> = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"];
```

## Tuples

-   Arrays with a fixed number of elements, each with a specific type.

```typescript
let vitalSigns: [number, number] = [120, 80]; // [systolic, diastolic]
let patientInfo: [string, number] = ["Alice", 30];
```

## Enums

-   Named set of related values (numeric or string).
    
```typescript
enum PatientStatus { Admitted, Discharged, UnderObservation }
let status: PatientStatus = PatientStatus.Admitted;
```

## Interfaces

-   Define the shape of an object.
    
```typescript
interface Patient {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  age: number;
  status: PatientStatus;
  vitals: [number, number];
}
```

## Classes

-   Blueprint for creating objects with data and behavior.
```typescript
class Doctor {
  constructor(public name: string, public specialty: string) {}
  prescribe(medication: string): void {
    console.log(`${this.name} prescribes ${medication}`);
  }
}
```

## 5. Step-by-Step Data Modeling & Code Walkthrough

1.  **Define enums and interfaces:**
    
	```typescript
	enum PatientStatus { Admitted, Discharged, UnderObservation }

	interface Patient {
	  id: number;
	  name: string;
	  age: number;
	  status: PatientStatus;
	  vitals: [number, number];
	}
	```
    
2.  **Create an array of patients:**
    
    ```typescript
	let patients: Patient[] = [
	  { id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 30, status: PatientStatus.Admitted, vitals: [120, 80] },
	  { id: 2, name: "Bob", age: 45, status: PatientStatus.UnderObservation, vitals: [130, 85] }
	];
    ```
    
3.  **Define a class for staff:**
    
    ```typescript
	class Nurse {
	  constructor(public name: string) {}
	  takeVitals(patient: Patient, vitals: [number, number]): void {
	    patient.vitals = vitals;
	    console.log(`${this.name} updated vitals for ${patient.name}`);
	  }
	}
    ```
    
4.  **Use tuples and enums for structured data:**

	```typescript
	let newVitals: [number, number] = [118, 76];
	let nurse = new Nurse("Carol");
	nurse.takeVitals(patients[0], newVitals);
	```
    

## 6. Interactive Challenge

**Your Turn!**

-   Define an enum  `Role`  for staff roles (Doctor, Nurse, Admin).
    
-   Create an interface  `Staff`  with fields for  `id`,  `name`, and  `role`.
    
-   Create an array of staff members using the interface and enum.
    
-   Write a function that prints a summary of all staff, showing their name and role.
   
## 7. Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

-   **Use interfaces to define object shapes for clarity and safety.**
    
-   **Prefer enums for related constants instead of plain numbers or strings.**
    
-   **Use tuples only when element order and type are fixed and meaningful.**
    
-   **Organize related data in arrays for easy processing.**
    
-   **Use classes for objects with both data and behavior.**
    

## 8. Quick Recap & Key Takeaways

-   User-defined types (arrays, tuples, enums, interfaces, classes) help you model real-world data safely and clearly.
    
-   They make your code more maintainable, scalable, and expressive.
    
-   Organize your data structures with type safety for fewer bugs and easier collaboration.
    

## 9. Optional: Programmer’s Workflow Checklist

-   Use enums for related sets of constants.
    
-   Define interfaces for all complex objects.
    
-   Use arrays for collections of similar items.
    
-   Use tuples for fixed-structure, ordered data.
    
-   Use classes for objects that combine data and methods.
    
-   Always annotate types for clarity and safety.
