## 1. Problem Statement

## **Chaos at "Maplewood Public Library"**

Maplewood Public Library’s software system is in disarray:

-   Rules like "members can’t borrow more than 5 books" are buried in code that handles website requests. When policies change, updates risk breaking other parts of the system.
    
-   The team wants to add new features (e.g., online reservations, late fines) but struggles because data access and business logic are tangled together.
    
-   Testing is nearly impossible-every small change requires rewriting large parts of the code.

**The challenge:**  
How do you redesign the system so that:

-   Rules and policies are clearly separated and easy to update?
    
-   Data storage details don’t interfere with how books are managed or loans are processed?
    
-   New features can be added without fear of breaking existing functionality?
    

## 2. Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

-   Structure code using  **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**  to separate rules, data, and user interactions.
    
-   Use the  **Repository Pattern**  to isolate data storage details from business logic.
    
-   Apply  **Dependency Injection**  to create modular, testable components.
    

## 3. Concept Introduction with Analogy

## **Analogy: The Library’s Organizational Chart**

Imagine the library has three teams:

1.  **Front Desk (Controller):**  Handles member requests (checkouts, returns).
    
2.  **Policy Team (Service):**  Manages rules (loan limits, fines).
    
3.  **Archives Team (Repository):**  Stores and retrieves books from the shelves.
    

Each team works independently:

-   The front desk doesn’t care  _how_  books are stored-it just asks the archives team to fetch them.
    
-   The policy team enforces rules without knowing  _where_  books are kept.
    
-   If the archives team reorganizes the shelves (changes storage systems), the other teams keep working as usual.
    

This separation prevents chaos and lets the library adapt to changes smoothly.



 **A. MVC Pattern: Separating Concerns**

| Layer        | Responsibility                        | Example in Library                 |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Model        | Data structure and validation        | Book, Member classes               |
| View         | Presentation (JSON, HTML)            | API responses                      |
| Controller   | Handles user requests/responses      | BookController routes              |
| Service      | Business logic (e.g., loan rules)    | Calculating fines, reservations    |
| Repository   | Data storage/retrieval               | Fetching books from storage        |


 **B. Repository Pattern: Isolate Storage Details**

-   **Repository Interface:**  Defines  _what_  operations are available (e.g.,  `findAllBooks()`,  `saveBook()`).
    
-   **Implementation:**  Handles  _how_  data is stored (e.g., in-memory, files, databases).
    

**Why?**

-   Change storage systems without rewriting business logic.
    
-   Test services with fake repositories (no real storage needed).
    

 **C. Dependency Injection: Building Modular Systems**

-   **Dependency Injection (DI):**  Provide components with their dependencies (e.g., services, repositories) instead of letting them create their own.
    
-   **Benefits:**
    
    -   Swap components easily (e.g., switch storage systems for testing).
        
    -   Avoid tight coupling between layers.
        

## 5. Step-by-Step Data Modeling & Code Walkthrough

## **A. Project Structure**
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/bvSpTRHw/day10.png" width="500px" />


## **B. Model: Define the Book Structure**
  ```typescript
// src/models/Book.ts  
export interface Book {  
  id: string;  
  title: string;  
  author: string;  
  isBorrowed: boolean;  
}  
  ``` 

## **C. Repository: Separate Storage Logic**

  ```typescript
// src/repositories/interfaces/IBookRepository.ts  
export interface IBookRepository {  
  findAll(): Promise<Book[]>;  
  findById(id: string): Promise<Book | null>;  
  save(book: Book): Promise<void>;  
}  

// src/repositories/InMemoryBookRepository.ts  
import { IBookRepository } from './interfaces/IBookRepository';  
import { Book } from '../models/Book';  

export class InMemoryBookRepository implements IBookRepository {  
  private books: Book[] = [];  

  async findAll(): Promise<Book[]> {  
    return this.books;  
  }  

  async findById(id: string): Promise<Book | null> {  
    return this.books.find(book => book.id === id) || null;  
  }  

  async save(book: Book): Promise<void> {  
    this.books.push(book);  
  }  
}  
  ```

## **D. Service: Enforce Business Rules**

  ```typescript
// src/services/BookService.ts  
import { IBookRepository } from '../repositories/interfaces/IBookRepository';  
import { Book } from '../models/Book';  

export class BookService {  
  constructor(private bookRepository: IBookRepository) {}  

  async borrowBook(bookId: string): Promise<Book> {  
    const book = await this.bookRepository.findById(bookId);  
    if (!book) throw new Error('Book not found');  
    if (book.isBorrowed) throw new Error('Book already borrowed');  

    const updatedBook = { ...book, isBorrowed: true };  
    await this.bookRepository.save(updatedBook);  
    return updatedBook;  
  }  
}  
  ```
 
## **E. Controller: Handle User Requests**
  ```typescript
// src/controllers/BookController.ts  
import { Request, Response } from 'express';  
import { BookService } from '../services/BookService';  

export class BookController {  
  constructor(private bookService: BookService) {}  

  async borrowBook(req: Request, res: Response): Promise<void> {  
    try {  
      const book = await this.bookService.borrowBook(req.params.id);  
      res.json(book);  
    } catch (error) {  
      res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });  
    }  
  }  
}  
  ```
  
## **F. Dependency Injection Setup**

  ```typescript
// src/app.ts  
import express from 'express';  
import { BookController } from './controllers/BookController';  
import { BookService } from './services/BookService';  
import { InMemoryBookRepository } from './repositories/InMemoryBookRepository';  

const app = express();  
app.use(express.json());  

// Initialize components  
const bookRepository = new InMemoryBookRepository();  
const bookService = new BookService(bookRepository);  
const bookController = new BookController(bookService);  

// Routes  
app.post('/books/:id/borrow', (req, res) => bookController.borrowBook(req, res));  

const port = 3000;  
app.listen(port, () => {  
  console.log(`Library system running on port ${port}`);  
});  
  ```
  
## 6. Challenge

**Your Turn!**

-   Add a  `returnBook`  method to  `BookService`  and  `BookController`.
    
-   Ensure the repository updates the book’s status when returned.
    

## 7. Common Pitfalls & Best Practices
| **Pitfall**                              | **Best Practice**                                       |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
|  Mixing data access in business logic   | Always use repositories for storage access            |
|  Hardcoding storage details             |  Depend on interfaces, not implementations             |
|  Not testing with mocks                 |  Use fake repositories for unit tests                  |


## 8. Quick Recap & Key Takeaways

-   **Separate layers**  (controllers, services, repositories) for clarity.
    
-   **Repository Pattern**  hides storage details from business rules.
    
-   **Dependency Injection**  makes components reusable and testable.

## 9 Optional: Programmer’s Workflow Checklist (MVC Pattern)

-   **Identify the main resources**  in your application (e.g., Book, User, Event).
    
-   **Define Models**  for each resource (data structure, validation rules).
    
-   **Create Controllers**  for each resource to handle user/API requests and responses.
    
-   **Write Services**  to contain business logic (rules, calculations, policies).
    
-   **Keep Controllers thin**-they should only coordinate input/output and call services.
    
-   **Never access data storage directly from controllers**-always go through services.
    
-   **If using repositories:**  Only services should interact with repositories for data access.
    
-   **Organize code into folders:**  `/models`,  `/controllers`,  `/services`  (and  `/repositories`  if needed).
    
-   **Document the responsibility of each layer**  so team members know where to add new logic.
    
-   **Test each layer independently**  (e.g., unit test services without controllers).
    
-   **Review regularly:**  Refactor if business logic creeps into controllers or data access leaks into services.
