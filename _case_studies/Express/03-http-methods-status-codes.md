## 1. Problem Statement
### Case Study: The Neighborhood Food Store Network
You manage a group of neighborhood food stores. Every day, staff and customers need to:

- Look up what products are available.
- Add new items to the inventory.
- Update details about existing products.
- Remove items that are no longer sold.

If requests get mixed up or answers are unclear, staff and customers get confused, orders are delayed, and the stores lose business.

### The challenge:
How do you organize and handle these different requests so that everyone always gets the right answer, and nothing falls through the cracks?

---

## 2. Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Organize and implement all types of requests (looking up, adding, changing, removing) in Express.
- Use and explain HTTP status codes for clear communication.
- Add and read headers for extra information and control.
- Write robust, RESTful endpoints for any resource.
- Understand the difference between GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
- Know when to use each status code, and why.

## 3. Concept Introduction with Analogy
### Analogy: The Restaurant Waiter
Imagine you’re at a restaurant:

- You can ask the waiter for the menu (look up).
- You can place a new order (add).
- You can change your order (update).
- You can cancel your order (remove).

The waiter always responds clearly:

- “Here’s your menu.” (success)
- “Your order is ready!” (success)
- “Sorry, we don’t have that item.” (not found)
- “Order cancelled.” (removed)
- “Could you clarify your request?” (bad request)

A well-trained waiter keeps the dining experience smooth and stress-free, just as a well-designed food store system keeps requests and answers organized.

### A. What Is a Request and a Response?
- **Request**: When someone asks your food store system for information or to perform an action.
- **Response**: The system’s answer to that request.

In web systems, these requests and responses travel over the internet using a protocol called HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol).

### B. HTTP Methods: The Verbs of Web Requests
HTTP methods are like verbs—they tell the system what action you want to perform.

#### The Core Methods (CRUD)

| Method | Everyday Action   | System Meaning         | Example in Food Store       |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| GET    | “Show me…”        | Retrieve/read data     | List all products           |
| POST   | “Add this…”       | Create new data        | Add a new product           |
| PUT    | “Replace this…”   | Update/replace existing data | Update all details of a product |
| PATCH  | “Change this part…” | Update part of existing data | Change only the price     |
| DELETE | “Remove this…”    | Delete data            | Remove a product            |

#### Why Use Different Methods?
- **Clarity**: Each method has a clear, agreed-upon meaning.
- **Safety**: GET requests don’t change data; POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE do.
- **Automation**: Tools and browsers know how to handle each method.

### C. HTTP Status Codes: The System’s Answers
Status codes are three-digit numbers sent with every response. They help the client (browser, app, or another system) understand what happened.

#### Status Code Categories

| Code Range | Meaning                 | Examples                          |
|------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1xx        | Informational           | Rarely used in APIs               |
| 2xx        | Success                 | 200 OK, 201 Created, 204 No Content |
| 3xx        | Redirection             | Not common in APIs                |
| 4xx        | Client Error (your fault) | 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found    |
| 5xx        | Server Error (our fault) | 500 Internal Server Error         |

#### Most Important Status Codes in REST APIs

| Code | When to Use                            | Example Scenario                         |
|------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 200  | Success (GET/PUT/PATCH)                | Products listed, product updated        |
| 201  | Resource created (POST)               | New product added                        |
| 204  | Success, no content (DELETE)          | Product deleted, nothing to return      |
| 400  | Bad request (invalid input)           | Missing product name or price           |
| 404  | Not found                             | Product doesn’t exist                   |
| 409  | Conflict (rare, e.g., duplicate)      | Trying to add a product that already exists |
| 500  | Internal server error                 | Unexpected bug or crash                 |

## D. HTTP Headers: Extra Info on Every Request/Response

Headers are like sticky notes attached to a package:

-   **Content-Type:**  Tells what’s inside (e.g., JSON, HTML).
    
-   **Authorization:**  Who is making the request.
    
-   **Custom headers:**  E.g., X-Store-Region: "Downtown".
    

**Example in Express:**
  ```typescript
res.setHeader("X-Store-Region", "Downtown");
  ```
  ## E. RESTful Routing: Mapping Real Actions to System Endpoints

REST (Representational State Transfer) is a set of conventions for organizing endpoints.

-   Each  **resource**  (e.g., products) has its own  **route**  (e.g.,  `/products`).
    
-   The  **method**  (GET, POST, etc.) tells what action to take.
    

**Examples:**

-   `GET /products`  → List all products
    
-   `POST /products`  → Add a new product
    
-   `GET /products/:id`  → Get details for one product
    
-   `PUT /products/:id`  → Replace all details for a product
    
-   `PATCH /products/:id/price`  → Update just the price
    
-   `DELETE /products/:id`  → Remove a product
    

## F. Error Handling and Edge Cases

-   Always check for missing or invalid data.
    
-   Always send a clear status code and message.
    
-   Never expose sensitive server errors to the client (use 500 for unexpected issues).
## G. Visual Recap: How a Request Flows

## H. Testing and Debugging Tips

-   Use tools like  **Postman**  or  **curl**  to send requests and see responses.
    
-   Always check status codes and response bodies.
    
-   Log requests and errors on the server for troubleshooting.
## Summary Table: HTTP Methods & Status Codes
| Action              | Method | Route                 | Status Codes         | Use Case                                   |
|---------------------|--------|-----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| List all products   | GET    | /products             | 200                  | Show all products                         |
| Get one product     | GET    | /products/:id         | 200, 404             | Show product or not found                 |
| Add product         | POST   | /products             | 201, 400             | Add new product, validate input           |
| Replace product     | PUT    | /products/:id         | 200, 400, 404        | Replace all fields, validate input        |
| Update price        | PATCH  | /products/:id/price   | 200, 400, 404        | Change price only                         |
| Remove product      | DELETE | /products/:id         | 204, 404             | Remove product, no content on success     |

## 5. Step-by-Step Data Modeling & Code Walkthrough
**A. Define Product Interface and Sample Data**
  ```typescript
interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  inStock: boolean;
}

let products: Product[] = [
  { id: "1", name: "Bananas", price: 1.5, inStock: true },
  { id: "2", name: "Apples", price: 2.0, inStock: false },
];
  ```
 **B. Create Express Router and Implement RESTful Routes**
   ```typescript
import { Router, Request, Response } from "express";
const router = Router();

// GET all products
router.get("/", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.status(200).json(products);
});

// GET product by ID
router.get("/:id", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const product = products.find(p => p.id === req.params.id);
  if (!product) {
    return res.status(404).json({ error: "Product not found" });
  }
  res.status(200).json(product);
});

// POST new product
router.post("/", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { name, price, inStock } = req.body;
  if (!name || price === undefined || inStock === undefined) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: "Missing required fields" });
  }
  const newProduct: Product = {
    id: (products.length + 1).toString(),
    name,
    price,
    inStock,
  };
  products.push(newProduct);
  res.status(201).json(newProduct);
});

// PUT update product
router.put("/:id", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const productIndex = products.findIndex(p => p.id === req.params.id);
  if (productIndex === -1) {
    return res.status(404).json({ error: "Product not found" });
  }
  const { name, price, inStock } = req.body;
  if (!name || price === undefined || inStock === undefined) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: "Missing required fields" });
  }
  products[productIndex] = { id: req.params.id, name, price, inStock };
  res.status(200).json(products[productIndex]);
});

// PATCH update product price
router.patch("/:id/price", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const product = products.find(p => p.id === req.params.id);
  const { price } = req.body;
  if (!product) {
    return res.status(404).json({ error: "Product not found" });
  }
  if (typeof price !== "number" || price < 0) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: "Invalid price" });
  }
  product.price = price;
  res.status(200).json(product);
});

// DELETE product
router.delete("/:id", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const productIndex = products.findIndex(p => p.id === req.params.id);
  if (productIndex === -1) {
    return res.status(404).json({ error: "Product not found" });
  }
  products.splice(productIndex, 1);
  res.sendStatus(204);
});

export default router;
  ```
  **Explanation for Each Route:**

-   **GET /products:**  Returns all products, always 200.
    
-   **GET /products/:id:**  Returns product or 404 if not found.
    
-   **POST /products:**  Validates input, returns 400 if missing fields, 201 if created.
    
-   **PUT /products/:id:**  Replaces all fields, returns 400 if missing, 404 if not found, 200 if updated.
    
-   **PATCH /products/:id/price:**  Only updates price, returns 400 if invalid, 404 if not found, 200 if updated.
    
-   **DELETE /products/:id:**  Removes product, 404 if not found, 204 if deleted.
    

## 6. Challenge

**Your Turn!**

-   Add a PATCH endpoint  `/products/:id/inStock`  to update only the  `inStock`  status of a product.
    
-   Return  `400 Bad Request`  if the new status is missing or not a boolean.
       
## 7. Quick Recap & Key Takeaways

-   Use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) to match CRUD operations.
    
-   Use status codes to clearly indicate success or failure.
    
-   Modular routes and clear responses improve reliability and user experience.
    
-   Always validate and structure your responses for clarity.
    
-   Headers can add useful metadata to responses.

## 8. Optional: Programmer’s Workflow Checklist

-   Use the correct HTTP method for each action.
    
-   Validate all input before processing.
    
-   Return appropriate status codes for every response.
    
-   Use clear, structured JSON for all responses.
    
-   Modularize routes for maintainability.
    
-   Test endpoints with tools like Postman or curl.
    
-   Log errors for debugging, but never leak sensitive info to clients.
    
-   Use headers for extra context when needed.
