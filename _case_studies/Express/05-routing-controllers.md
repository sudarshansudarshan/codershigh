## 1. Problem Statement: The Overwhelmed Bakery

## **A Day at "Crumb & Craft Bakery"**

Crumb & Craft Bakery started as a cozy neighborhood shop. Orders were simple:

-   A customer would walk in, ask for a cake, and the bakers would jot down details by hand.
    
-   Mistakes were rare, and everyone knew each other.
    

But after becoming a city-wide sensation, things spiraled:

-   **Lost Orders:**  Staff scribbled requests on sticky notes that got misplaced.
  
-   **Wrong Assignments:**  Sometimes, a bread order ended up in the cake station, or a gluten-free request was missed.
    
-   **No Oversight:**  New hires didn’t know who handled which type of order, leading to confusion and delays.
    
-   **Missed Details:**  Orders with missing pickup dates or flavors slipped through, causing wasted ingredients and unhappy customers.
    

**The breaking point:**  
During a holiday rush, the bakery received 500 online orders in an hour.

-   **Missing Allergies:**  A child with a nut allergy nearly got a peanut butter cake.
    
-   **Inventory Chaos:**  The system allowed orders for 1,000 croissants when only 100 were in stock.
    
-   **Mixed Messages:**  Some customers got confirmation emails; others heard nothing.
    

**The challenge:**  
How do you redesign the bakery’s workflow so that:

1.  Every order goes to the right team.
    
2.  Mistakes (like missing allergies or impossible quantities) are caught early.
    
3.  Customers  _always_  get clear, timely updates.
    

## 2. Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

-   Organize workflows into specialized teams (routing controllers).
    
-   Add checkpoints to catch errors early (middleware).
    
-   Validate orders for accuracy before they’re processed (request validation).
    

## 3. Concept Introduction with Analogy

## **Analogy: The Bakery Assembly Line**

Imagine redesigning Crumb & Craft’s kitchen into a well-oiled assembly line:

1.  **Specialized Stations (Routing Controllers):**
    
    -   **Order Desk:**  Handles new orders and customer inquiries.
        
    -   **Baking Team:**  Manages inventory and bakes items.
        
    -   **Quality Control:**  Inspects orders before they go out.
        
2.  **Checkpoints (Middleware):**
    
    -   **Allergy Check:**  Scans every order for dietary restrictions.
        
    -   **Inventory Check:**  Ensures stock levels are updated in real time.
        
    -   **Logging:**  Tracks how long each order takes to complete.
        
3.  **Inspectors (Validation):**
    
    -   **Order Form Check:**  Rejects forms missing flavors, dates, or quantities.
        
    -   **Stock Check:**  Blocks orders that exceed available inventory.
       
## **What Is a Controller?**

-   In Express (and web frameworks in general), a  **controller**  is a module (usually a class or file) that groups related request handlers together.
    
-   Each controller is responsible for a “resource” or “feature” (e.g., orders, inventory, users).
    
-   This modular approach:
    
    -   Makes code easier to read and maintain.
        
    -   Prevents accidental overlap or confusion.
        
    -   Allows teams to work on different features independently.
    
**Without Controllers (Flat Routing):**
  ```typescript
// routes.js
app.post("/orders", ...);
app.get("/orders/:id", ...);
app.post("/inventory", ...);
app.get("/inventory/:item", ...);
// All logic is mixed together.
  ```
  
  **With Controllers (Modular Routing):**
  ```typescript
// OrderController.js
router.post("/", ...);
router.get("/:id", ...);

// InventoryController.js
router.post("/", ...);
router.get("/:item", ...);

// Each controller is mounted at its own base route.
app.use("/orders", OrderController);
app.use("/inventory", InventoryController);
  ```


 **A. Organizing Workflows with Routing Controllers**

**Problem:**  Orders were handled by anyone, leading to chaos.  
**Solution:**  Assign specialized teams to specific tasks.

 **1. Defining Teams (Controllers)**

  ```typescript
// Team 1: Order Desk
@Controller("/orders")
export class OrderController {
  @Post("/")
  createOrder(@Body() order: Order) {
    // Forward to baking team
  }

  @Get("/:id")
  getOrderStatus(@Param("id") orderId: string) {
    // Check progress
  }
}

// Team 2: Baking Team
@Controller("/baking")
export class BakingController {
  @Post("/start")
  startBaking(@Body() order: Order) {
    // Check inventory and bake
  }
}
  ```
 **2. How It Works**

-   **`@Controller("/orders")`:**  This team handles all requests starting with  `/orders`.
    
-   **`@Post("/")`:**  The order desk’s form for new orders.
    
-   **`@Get("/:id")`:**  Lets customers check their order status.
    

**B. Adding Checkpoints (Middleware)**

**Problem:**  Mistakes like nut allergies or oversold stock slipped through.  
**Solution:**  Add checkpoints to inspect orders before they’re processed.

**1. Types of Checkpoints**
| Checkpoint         | Purpose                                    | Example            |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Allergy Check      | Scans for nuts, gluten, etc.              | allergyMiddleware  |
| Inventory Check    | Ensures stock levels are sufficient       | inventoryMiddleware|
| Logging            | Tracks order timelines                    | loggingMiddleware  |

**2. Custom Checkpoint Example**
  ```typescript
// Allergy Check Middleware
@Middleware()
export class AllergyMiddleware implements ExpressMiddlewareInterface {
  use(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
    const { ingredients } = req.body;
    if (ingredients.includes("peanuts")) {
      throw new Error("Peanut allergy alert!");
    }
    next();
  }
}

// Attach to the order workflow
@UseBefore(AllergyMiddleware)
@Post("/orders")
createOrder(@Body() order: Order) { ... }
  ```
**C. Validating Orders (Request Validation)**

**Problem:**  Orders with missing/wrong details wasted time and ingredients.  
**Solution:**  Validate orders before they enter the workflow.

 **1. Validation Rules**
```typescript
class Order {
  @IsDate()
  pickupDate: Date;

  @IsString()
  flavor: string;

  @IsInt()
  @Min(1)
  @Max(100)
  quantity: number;
}
```

**2. Automatic Validation**
```typescript
@Post("/orders")
createOrder(@Body({ validate: true }) order: Order) {
  // Only runs if validation passes
}
```

**Failed Validation Response:**
```typescript
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "Quantity must be at least 1"
}
```
## 5. Step-by-Step Data Modeling & Code Walkthrough

Let’s walk through how our “Crumb & Craft Bakery” solves its real-world chaos using controllers, step by step:

**A. Defining the Order Data Structure**

Remember how orders were once scribbled on sticky notes and got lost?  
We’ll fix that by defining a clear, digital structure for every order-so nothing is forgotten.
```typescript
interface Order {
  id: string;
  customerName: string;
  flavor: string;
  quantity: number;
  pickupDate: string;
}
```
**Explanation:**

-   Every order must have an ID (so it never gets mixed up), the customer’s name, the cake flavor, quantity, and a pickup date.
    
-   By making these fields required, we ensure that no order is missing crucial details (no more “mystery cakes” or missed birthdays).
    

 **B. Creating a Safe Place for Orders**

Instead of sticky notes, we’ll use a digital list where every order is stored and can be easily found by any team member.

```typescript
const orders: Order[] = [
  { id: "1", customerName: "Maria", flavor: "vanilla", quantity: 2, pickupDate: "2024-07-10" },
];

```


**Explanation:**

-   This array represents the bakery’s “order book”-every new order gets added here, and staff can look up any order by its ID.
    

**C. Building the Order Controller: The New “Order Desk”**

We create a dedicated “Order Desk” team (controller) whose only job is to handle customer orders-no more confusion about who’s responsible.
```typescript
import { JsonController, Get, Post, Param, Body } from "routing-controllers";

@JsonController("/orders")
export class OrderController {
  @Get("/")
  getAll() {
    return orders;
  }

  @Get("/:id")
  getOne(@Param("id") id: string) {
    const order = orders.find(o => o.id === id);
    if (!order) {
      return { status: "error", error: "Order not found" };
    }
    return { status: "success", data: order };
  }

  @Post("/")
  create(@Body() order: Omit<Order, "id">) {
    const newOrder: Order = {
      ...order,
      id: (orders.length + 1).toString(),
    };
    orders.push(newOrder);
    return { status: "success", data: newOrder };
  }
}

```

**Explanation:**

-   **`@Get("/")`:**  Lets staff see all orders-no more lost requests.
    
-   **`@Get("/:id")`:**  Anyone can check the status of a specific order (e.g., “Is Maria’s cake ready?”).
    
-   **`@Post("/")`:**  New orders are added in a standard way, with all required details. The system assigns a unique ID, so two “Maria”s never get mixed up.
    

**D. Registering the Controller in the Bakery’s Workflow**

Just as you’d tell new staff, “All cake orders go to the Order Desk,” we register our controller so Express knows where to send each request.

```typescript
import { JsonController, Get, Post, Param, Body } from "routing-controllers";

@JsonController("/orders")
export class OrderController {
  @Get("/")
  getAll() {
    return orders;
  }

  @Get("/:id")
  getOne(@Param("id") id: string) {
    const order = orders.find(o => o.id === id);
    if (!order) {
      return { status: "error", error: "Order not found" };
    }
    return { status: "success", data: order };
  }

  @Post("/")
  create(@Body() order: Omit<Order, "id">) {
    const newOrder: Order = {
      ...order,
      id: (orders.length + 1).toString(),
    };
    orders.push(newOrder);
    return { status: "success", data: newOrder };
  }
}

```
**Explanation:**

-   This sets up the bakery’s “front counter”-all order-related requests are routed to the OrderController, so nothing is misplaced.

## 6. Interactive Challenge / Mini-Project

**Your Turn!**

-   Create a  `BakingController`  for  `/baking`  routes.
    
-   Add a  `POST /baking/start`  endpoint to start baking an order.
    
-   Add a  `GET /baking/status/:id`  endpoint to check the baking status of an order.

## 7. Common Pitfalls & Best Practices
| Pitfall                | Best Practice                                |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Mixing unrelated routes | Group related routes in controllers         |
| Duplicating logic       | Use shared services/inject dependencies     |
| Not using base routes   | Always prefix controllers with a base       |
| Inconsistent responses  | Standardize response format                 |



## 8. Quick Recap & Key Takeaways

-   **Controllers**  group related routes for clarity and maintainability.
    
-   **Modular routing**  makes code easier to grow and debug.
    
-   **Controller libraries**  like  `routing-controllers`  add powerful features (decorators, DI, middleware).
    

## 9. Optional: Programmer’s Workflow Checklist

-   Define controllers for each major resource or workflow.
    
-   Use clear base routes (e.g.,  `/orders`,  `/baking`).
    
-   Standardize response formats.
    
-   Register all controllers in your app entry point.
    
-   Test each controller independently.
