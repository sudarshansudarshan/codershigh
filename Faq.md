## Learning Style

### How do sessions usually work?
A typical session follows this flow:
1. **Start with a question or puzzle**
2. **Brainstorm together** (many approaches, open discussion)
3. **Facilitator connects ideas to key concepts/algorithms**
4. **Wrap up with insights** so participants can apply the idea in new situations

### What do you mean by “learning from first principles”?
It means starting from the *core idea* behind a problem and building up understanding step-by-step—so you can reason your way to solutions instead of relying on memorized patterns.

### Is the learning math-heavy?
No. CodersHigh intentionally avoids heavy mathematics as a barrier. The focus is on intuition, clear thinking, and concept-building through discussion.

### Do you teach the latest frameworks or trendy tools?
CodersHigh is not built around chasing frameworks or buzzwords. Instead, it focuses on timeless ideas and patterns—especially those that make algorithms feel *natural*.

### What kinds of topics do you cover?
CodersHigh explores “100 great ideas” in Computer Science and Data Science through inspirational case studies and story-like problem journeys. The exact set of problems may vary by cohort.

### Is this more theory or more practice?
It’s a blend:
- **Theory**, but explained in a grounded, intuitive way
- **Practice**, via problem solving and collaborative brainstorming  
The goal is **deep understanding + practical problem-solving ability**.
