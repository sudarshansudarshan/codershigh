# Joy of Computing Workshop - Class Notes

## Introduction

In today's workshop on the Joy of Computing, we explored a variety of intriguing topics that blend mathematics, computing, and real-world applications. The session covered:

- **Sudarshan's Inc Problem**: A game that challenges our understanding of averages and strategic investment.
- **Concept of Averages**: Case studies highlighting how averages can sometimes lead to paradoxical or counterintuitive conclusions.
- **Programming Puzzle**: Simulating the Sudarshan's Inc game to analyze potential profits or losses.
- **Additional Discussions**: Insights into auctions, CAPTCHA systems, and algorithmic recommendations on platforms like YouTube.

---

## 1. Sudarshan's Inc Problem

### Understanding the Game

**Sudarshan's Inc** offers a unique lottery game with the following rules:

- **Investment**: Participants invest any amount less than ₹50,000.
- **Winning Condition**: If your investment is above the average investment of all participants, you win.
- **Prize**: Winners receive a total of ₹50,000 (inclusive of their initial investment).
  - *Example*: If you invest ₹10,000 and win, you receive an additional ₹40,000.
- **Losing Condition**: If your investment is below the average, you lose your entire investment.

### Analyzing Sudarshan's Benefit

- **Revenue Generation**:
  - The company collects all investments from participants.
  - Only those above the average receive payouts.
- **Profit Mechanism**:
  - Since not everyone can be above average, there will always be losers whose investments contribute to the company's profit.
  - The company profits from the total investments of the losers minus the payouts to the winners.

## 2. The Concept of Averages

Averages are a fundamental statistical concept but can sometimes lead to unexpected interpretations.

### Case Studies

#### a. Migration and Average IQ

- **Scenario**: A group of people migrates from India to a neighboring country with a lower average IQ.
- **Outcome**:
  - **India**: The average IQ increases because lower-than-average individuals have left.
  - **Neighboring Country**: The average IQ also increases because the immigrants have a higher IQ than the country's average.
- **Explanation**: This paradox illustrates how averages can shift based on the movement of individuals relative to the mean.

#### b. The Optimistic Professor

- **Scenario**: A professor expects all students to score above the class average.
- **Reality Check**:
  - Mathematically impossible, as the average is calculated based on all scores.
  - Highlights a common misunderstanding of statistical averages.

#### c. The Fire and Ice Paradox

- **Scenario**: A person has their hair on fire and feet in ice water.
- **Average Feeling**:
  - On average, they might seem to feel neutral.
- **Reality**:
  - The person experiences extreme discomfort, demonstrating that averages can sometimes mask individual experiences.

### Discussion on Averages

- **Distribution Symmetry**:
  - In a perfectly symmetrical distribution, the number of values above and below the average is equal.
- **Implications in Sudarshan's Game**:
  - Not all participants can be above average; inevitably, some will lose.
  - Understanding this helps in strategizing investment amounts.

## 3. Programming Puzzle: Simulating Sudarshan's Inc Game

### Objective

- **Task**: Write a program to simulate 100 people playing Sudarshan's Inc game.
- **Goal**: Determine if Sudarshan's Inc profits or incurs a loss.

### Steps to Solve

#### a. Choosing a Distribution

- **Uniform Distribution**:
  - Every investment amount between ₹0 and ₹50,000 has an equal chance.
- **Normal (Gaussian) Distribution**:
  - Investment amounts cluster around a mean value with a certain standard deviation.

#### b. Simulating Investments

- **Generate Random Investments**:
  - Use a random number generator based on the chosen distribution.
  - Ensure all investments are less than ₹50,000.

#### c. Calculating the Average

- **Compute Average Investment**:
  - Sum all investments and divide by 100 (number of participants).

#### d. Determining Winners and Losers

- **Winners**:
  - Participants who invested above the average.
  - Each winner receives ₹50,000 total (including their investment).
- **Losers**:
  - Participants who invested below the average.
  - They lose their entire investment.

#### e. Calculating Profit or Loss

- **Total Payouts**:
  - ₹50,000 multiplied by the number of winners.
- **Total Investments Collected**:
  - Sum of all losers' investments.
- **Profit/Loss**:
  - Profit if total investments collected exceed total payouts.
  - Loss if total payouts exceed investments collected.

### Possible Outcomes

- **Profit Scenario**:
  - More participants invest below the average, leading to higher profits for Sudarshan's Inc.
- **Loss Scenario**:
  - Unlikely but possible if the distribution of investments is skewed.

## 4. Additional Discussions

### a. The Mobile Phone Auction (Vickrey's Model)

- **Auction Type**: Second-price sealed-bid auction.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Bidders submit sealed bids without knowing others' bids.
  - Highest bidder wins but pays the price of the second-highest bid.
- **Strategic Implications**:
  - Encourages truthful bidding, as overbidding doesn't increase the price paid unless another bid is close.
  - Reduces the winner's curse, where the winner overpays due to competition.

### b. The Human CAPTCHA Project

- **Purpose of CAPTCHAs**:
  - Distinguish between humans and bots.
  - Utilize human input to solve complex tasks.
- **Dual Tasks in CAPTCHAs**:
  - **Verification Task**: Ensures the user is human (e.g., typing distorted text).
  - **Data Collection Task**: Gathers data to train AI models (e.g., identifying objects in images).
- **Examples**:
  - Identifying zebra crossings helps improve self-driving car algorithms.
  - Transcribing blurred words aids in digitizing books.

### c. YouTube's Recommendation Algorithm

- **Algorithm Complexity**:
  - Analyzes user behavior to suggest relevant videos.
  - Factors include watch history, likes, shares, and session duration.
- **Creator Strategies**:
  - Content creators optimize videos to rank higher (e.g., clickbait titles, engaging thumbnails).
- **The Moving Target Phenomenon**:
  - As creators adapt to the algorithm, YouTube updates it to maintain content quality.
  - This continuous evolution prevents exploitation and enhances user experience.

---

## 1. Impression Network Data Collection

### Activity Overview

We began with an interactive exercise designed to map social impressions within the classroom:

- **Task**: Each participant was asked to engage with others and note down the names of individuals they found impressive.
- **Objective**: To collect data that represents a network graph of students based on mutual impressions.

### Brainstorming and Analysis

We encouraged you to brainstorm and formulate deep questions about the collected data:

#### a. Potential Inferences

- **Identifying Influencers**: Who are the most frequently mentioned individuals?
- **Community Clusters**: Are there subgroups within the class where impressions are stronger?
- **Reciprocity**: Do impressions tend to be mutual?

#### b. Types of Analysis

- **Network Analysis**: Using graph theory to analyze connections.
  - **Degree Centrality**: Measuring the number of direct connections each individual has.
  - **Betweenness Centrality**: Identifying individuals who act as bridges between groups.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: If additional data is available (e.g., reasons for impressions), analyzing the sentiments behind them.
- **Visualization**: Creating network graphs to visually represent relationships.

#### c. Potential Business Ideas

- **Personalized Networking Platforms**: Creating apps that help people identify and connect with influential individuals.
- **Team Building Tools**: Assisting organizations in forming effective teams based on interpersonal impressions.
- **Marketing Strategies**: Leveraging influential individuals for product promotions within social networks.

## 2. Markov Chains and Mood Switching

### Introduction to Markov Chains

A **Markov chain** is a mathematical system that undergoes transitions from one state to another on a state space. It is characterized by being **memoryless**—the next state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it.

### Two-State Markov Chain: Happy and Sad

#### a. Setting Up the Model

- **States**: Happy (H) and Sad (S).
- **Transition Probabilities**:
  - Probability of staying in the same state or switching to the other.
  - Represented in a **transition matrix**.

#### b. Excel Simulation

- **Initial Distribution**: An initial number of people in each state.
- **Iterations**:
  - Applied the transition probabilities to update the state distribution over several iterations.
- **Observation**:
  - The number of people in each state fluctuated initially.
  - After approximately 10 iterations, the distribution converged.

#### c. Convergence to Steady-State Distribution

- **Steady-State**: The state where the distribution remains constant over iterations.
- **Properties**:
  - Independent of the initial distribution.
  - Determined solely by the transition probabilities.
- **Mathematical Explanation**:
  - The steady-state distribution is the **eigenvector** associated with the eigenvalue 1 of the transition matrix.

### Three-State Markov Chain: Park, Apartment, Restaurant

#### a. Expanding the Model

- **States**: Park (P), Apartment (A), Restaurant (R).
- **Transition Matrix**:
  - A 3x3 matrix representing probabilities of moving between states.

#### b. Observations

- **Convergence**:
  - Similar to the two-state model, the system converged to a steady-state distribution.
- **Interpretation**:
  - Regardless of where people start, they eventually spend a predictable proportion of time in each location.

### Why Does Convergence Occur?

#### a. Role of Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

- **Eigenvectors**:
  - Vectors that do not change direction under a linear transformation.
- **Eigenvalues**:
  - Scalars representing how the eigenvector is scaled during the transformation.
- **In Markov Chains**:
  - The steady-state distribution is the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 1.

#### b. Mathematical Insight

- **Transition Matrix \( T \)**:
  - Describes the probabilities of moving from one state to another.
- **Steady-State Condition**:
  - \( T \cdot \pi = \pi \), where \( \pi \) is the steady-state distribution.
- **Convergence**:
  - Due to the **Perron-Frobenius theorem**, which guarantees a unique largest eigenvalue (which is 1 for stochastic matrices) and a corresponding positive eigenvector.

### Connection to Hidden Markov Models

While we discussed Markov chains, it's important to distinguish them from **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)**:

- **Markov Chains**:
  - The states are directly observable.
- **Hidden Markov Models**:
  - The states are not directly observable (hidden), but outputs dependent on the states are observable.
- **Applications**:
  - HMMs are widely used in fields like speech recognition, bioinformatics, and finance.

## 3. The Online Hiring Problem (Secretary Problem)

### Problem Description

You are faced with a sequence of options (e.g., job applicants, salaries, potential partners) that you must evaluate one at a time:

- **Objective**: Select the best (e.g., highest salary, most qualified applicant).
- **Constraints**:
  - You cannot return to a previous option once you have rejected it.
  - You must decide immediately after viewing each option whether to accept or reject it.

### Optimal Stopping Theory

This problem is a classic example of the **Optimal Stopping Theory** in probability and statistics.

#### a. The Strategy

- **Sampling Phase**:
  - **Reject** the first \( n/e \) candidates outright (where \( n \) is the total number of candidates and \( e \) is Euler's number, approximately 2.71828).
  - **Record** the highest value among the sampled candidates.
- **Selection Phase**:
  - **Accept** the first candidate who is better than all the candidates in the sampling phase.
- **Outcome**:
  - This strategy maximizes the probability of selecting the best candidate, with a success rate of about 37%.

#### b. Mathematical Justification

- **Optimal Threshold**:
  - The optimal number of candidates to sample is \( k = n/e \).
- **Probability of Success**:
  - The maximum probability of selecting the best candidate is \( 1/e \) (~36.8%).
- **Intuition**:
  - Balances the trade-off between gathering enough information and the risk of the best candidate appearing early.

### Application to the Salary Problem

#### a. Scenario

- **Goal**: Choose the job offer with the highest salary.
- **Process**:
  - Salaries are presented one by one in random order.
  - You must accept or reject each salary when presented.

#### b. Implementing the Strategy

1. **Sampling Phase**:
   - **Do not accept** any salary offers during the first \( n/e \) interviews.
   - **Keep track** of the highest salary seen so far.

2. **Selection Phase**:
   - **Accept** the first salary that exceeds the highest salary from the sampling phase.
   - If no salary exceeds this, accept the last one.

#### c. Outcomes

- **High Success Rate**:
  - This method ensures a high probability of selecting the highest or near-highest salary.
- **Risk Management**:
  - Reduces the chance of settling for a lower salary due to early acceptance.

### Real-World Applications

#### a. Dating and Marriage

- **Objective**: Find the best life partner.
- **Application**:
  - Date and evaluate a sample of potential partners without committing.
  - Commit to the next person who is better than all previous ones.

#### b. Hiring a Secretary

- **Objective**: Hire the most qualified candidate.
- **Application**:
  - Interview a portion of applicants without offering the job.
  - Hire the next applicant who surpasses the best from the initial interviews.

#### c. Apartment Hunting

- **Objective**: Rent the best available apartment.
- **Application**:
  - Visit a fraction of available apartments.
  - Choose the next one that is better than those already seen.

#### d. General Decision-Making

- **Optimal Stopping** is applicable in any scenario where decisions are sequential and irrevocable, and the goal is to maximize payoff.
