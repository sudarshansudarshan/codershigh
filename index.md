## Introduction {#introduction}
Coders High is lot more than what it takes to be a coding club—it’s a community for curious minds who want to explore the beauty and elegance of algorithms. We
believe that programming is a powerful tool for expressing ideas, but the
real magic lies in understanding the underlying concepts and patterns that
make solutions possible.

Our sessions are centered around inquiry and discovery. Instead of
following rote tutorials or chasing the latest frameworks, we dive into
carefully chosen case studies that spark conversation and experimentation.
You’ll collaborate with peers, ask questions and develop problem‑solving
strategies together. It’s about cultivating intuition, creativity and
confidence through shared exploration.

And because we’re driven by the joy of learning, there’s no pressure to
turn every lesson into a résumé bullet. Coders High is intentionally free
of placement prep or industry buzzwords. Here, the focus is on the thrill
of intellectual adventure and the friendships formed along the way.

## What is Coders High? {#what-is-coders-high}
Coders High involves learning 100 great ideas in Computer Science and Data Science told through inspirational case studies and climax filled story lines. We start with a question or a puzzle followed by extensive brain storming session where participants discuss various approaches to solve the problem. The facilitator then introduces the relevant concepts and algorithms that can be used to solve the problem effectively. This kind of learning helps participants to develop a deep understanding of the concepts and their ability to apply the ideas in novel situations. Participants have particularly mentioned the joy of discussing various approaches to solve a problem and the satisfaction of arriving at an optimal solution through collaborative effort. Coders High is more of an experience apart from being a one of its kind learning opportunity.   


## The Alumni {#alumni}
Many of our early cohorts have been drawn from the *IITM BS program*, and
nearly all of them have gone on to complete their degrees successfully 
. They often credit Coders High as a key support system—a
place to stay connected, motivated and inspired while tackling the
program’s meticulously planned curriculum.

By working together on algorithmic problems and sharing their
experiences, these alumni formed a close‑knit network that persisted long
after the coders high sessions ended. They still collaborate on projects,
offer advice to current participants and return to share their insights
and stories. Their collective journey illustrates how a curiosity‑driven
community can not only help you grasp complex concepts but also sustain
your enthusiasm throughout challenging academic endeavors.

We will soon have a list of our alumni and their testimonials on this page. 


## How do we Select? {#how-do-we-select}

The selection is purely through nominations of existing members. We will soon post the details in this section. You will also be notified in the whatsapp group/discord server.
