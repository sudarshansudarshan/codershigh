## 1. The Coin Toss Claim

I claim that I have the magical ability to predict whether the coin that you toss will yield a head or a tail.

How many experiments should you conduct to confirm that I really have this ability?  
Is one enough? Two? Three? Hundred? Thousand?

What does it mean to be convinced, and how does repeated verification change your confidence—without ever truly proving the claim with absolute certainty?



## 2. The Prisoners and the Cells

There are 300 prisoners, and some of them hate each other. We are given all pairs of people who hate each other.

If two prisoners who hate each other are put in the same cell, they may end up killing each other.

The problem is to put these 300 prisoners into **3 cells**, each with a capacity of **100**, such that no two prisoners who hate each other are placed in the same cell.

Is it possible to convince someone that such a placement exists **without revealing the actual placement**?



## 3. The Emperor, the Heir, and the Sudoku

There is an emperor who remains unmarried all his life. He has a child (or children) from a secret partner and does not want to divulge any further information.

He declares that his child/ren will become adults after **10 years or more**, and they will then come forward to claim his kingdom, assets, and throne. It is agreed upon before his death that it would be the duty of his brother to hand over the throne to the rightful heir(s).

Before his death, the emperor releases a **25×25 Sudoku** with a *unique solution*, which is kept secret. He states that **only his children know its solution**.

After 10 years, Mr. Chetan appears and claims the throne. A high committee is set up to examine whether he is a genuine heir apparent. According to the emperor’s will, *anyone who can solve the Sudoku has the right to the throne*.

Mr. Chetan claims that he knows the solution, but refuses to reveal it. His reasoning is that once revealed, someone else could copy it and falsely claim the throne as another heir. He believes his secret father may have had more children, and that all of them should have the right to come forward later and claim their share.

How can Mr. Chetan convince the committee that he **knows the solution**, without ever **revealing the solution itself**?



## 4. Generate big prime numbers

1. Can you generate a big prime number using a python library? Use any python library that can give you big prime numbers. How big a prime number can you generate?
2. Can you take a random 10 digit number n, check if it is prime or not, if it is not go to n+1, keep checking the next number until you get a prime number. Now, the big question is, how easy was it for you to generate a 10 digit prime number?
3. Can you generate a 100 digit prime number using this method? Just start with a random 100 digit number and keep adding 1 to it until you get a prime number.
4. Generate a big 100 digit prime number P and another 100 digit prime number Q. Multiply them to get $$PQ$$, can you factor it easily?
5. Think of an application of what all you learnt in this section.
